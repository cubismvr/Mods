//
// ABOUT THE FILEFORMAT
// --------------------
// Puzzles in Cubism are described by a JSON file with a .cube file extension. The file has 3 main nodes:
// 1. meta: metadata describing the puzzle.
// 2. grid: coordinates of the puzzle's grid cells.
// 3. pieces: puzzle pieces, described by their color and cubes that make up their shape (segments). Uses same coordinate system as the grid.
//
// The following conditions need to be met for a puzzle to show up correctly within Cubism. If there's an error in parsing a puzzle, it will be ignored and not show up in-game.
// 1. File must be valid JSON, use the .cube file extension, and be placed in the correct folder.
// 2. File must have a meta, grid, and pieces node defined. Meta must have name, id, difficulty, and puzzleFormatVersion declared. 
// 3. The origin for the puzzle's grid cells must be placed in the lower corner of the puzzle's bounding box. If not, the puzzle will appear off-centered, both when it spawns, and in the menu.
// 4. Pieces need to be defined in their solved position. This will be used to render the solved state in the menu button after the puzzle has been solved.
